  /* Note about volume in DirectSound:
setVolume
public void setVolume(int volume);


Changes the volume of a sound buffer. 

Return Value: 

No return value. 

Parameter Description 
volume  New volume requested for this sound buffer. Values range from 0 (0 dB, no volume adjustment) to -10,000 (-100 dB, essentially silent). DirectSound does not currently support amplification.  


Remarks: 

Volume units of are in hundredths of decibels, where 0 is the original volume of the stream. 

Positive decibels correspond to amplification and negative decibels correspond to attenuation. The decibel scale corresponds to the logarithmic hearing characteristics of the ear. An attenuation of 10 dB makes a buffer sound half as loud; an attenuation of 20 dB makes a buffer sound one quarter as loud. DirectSound does not currently support amplification. 

The pan control is cumulative with the volume control. 

See Also: getPan, getVolume, setPan

CONCLUSION: we need some conversion [0-128] -> [-10000, 0](log)

=====

Same for PAN:
setPan
public void setPan(int pan);


Specifies the relative volume between the left and right channels. 

Return Value: 

No return value. 

Parameter Description 
pan  Relative volume between the left and right channels. This value has a range of -10,000 to 10,000 and is measured in hundredths of a decibel.  


Remarks: 

0 is the neutral value for pan and indicates that both channels are at full volume (attenuated by 0 decibels). At any other setting, one of the channels is at full volume and the other is attenuated. For example, a pan of -2173 means that the left channel is at full volume and the right channel is attenuated by 21.73 dB. Similarly, a pan of 870 means that the left channel is attenuated by 8.7 dB and the right channel is at full volume. 

A pan of -10,000 means that the right channel is silent and the sound is "all the way to the left," while a pan of 10,000 means that the left channel is silent and the sound is "all the way to the right." 

The pan control is cumulative with the volume control. 

See Also: getPan, getVolume, setVolume 

=====

Just in case, here's setFrequency:
setFrequency
public void setFrequency(int frequency);


Sets the frequency at which the audio samples are played. 

Return Value: 

No return value. 

Parameter Description 
frequency  New frequency, in Hz, at which to play the audio samples. The value must be between 100 and 100,000. If the value is 0, the frequency is reset to the current buffer format. This format is specified in the createSoundBuffer method.  


Remarks: 

Increasing or decreasing the frequency changes the perceived pitch of the audio data. This method does not affect the format of the buffer.
