This is GNU FreeDink, a portable and enhanced version of the Dink
Smallwood game engine.

GNU FreeDink v1.07
------------------

This version aims at running the original game as well as its D-Mods
(Dink MODules, or add-ons), with close compatibility, under new
platforms. For example: play existing D-Mods under GNU/Linux.

On the technical level, GNU FreeDink v1.07 is also where the internals
of the engines experience a clean-up to allow for portability and
later improvements.


GNU FreeDink v1.08
------------------

This version, not started yet, is the next step. The plan is to start
improving the game engine, possibly breaking backward compatibility
(such as fixing bugs in the script engine or palette manager). It will
not be meant to play every old D-Mods perfectly, it will be meant to
create new D-Mods with a refined engine.



GNU
---

FreeDink is part of the GNU project, whose aim is to create "GNU", a
completely free (as in freedom) operating system. Its most famous
variant these days is GNU/Linux. A engine to play the Dink Smallwood
game and D-Mods is definitely a must for the GNU OS ;) Check
www.gnu.org for more information.
