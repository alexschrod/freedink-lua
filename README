About
-----

GNU FreeDink aims at running the original game as well as its D-Mods
(Dink MODules, or add-ons), with close compatibility, under new
platforms. For example: play existing D-Mods under GNU/Linux.

On the technical level, the internals of the engines experience a
clean-up to allow for portability and later improvements.

FreeDink can run in 2 modes:

* v1.08 (default): this matches the latest release of the Dink engine,
  which includes some new features and some backward-incompatible
  changes. Use it for recent D-Mods.

* v1.07 (with option '--v1.07'): this matches v1.07 of the Dink
  engine, essentially unmodified since 1998. Use it to play D-Mods
  released before 2006.

Next step is extending the engine while preserving accurate support
for released D-Mods.

GNU
---

FreeDink is part of the GNU project, whose aim is to create "GNU", a
completely free (as in freedom) operating system. Its most famous
variant these days is GNU/Linux. A engine to play the Dink Smallwood
game and D-Mods is definitely a must for the GNU OS ;) Check
http://www.gnu.org/ for more information.
