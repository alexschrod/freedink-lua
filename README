About Dink Smallwood
--------------------

Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game for MS Windows,
similar to Zelda, made by RTsoft. Besides twisted humour, it includes
the actual game editor, allowing players to create hundreds of new
adventures called Dink Modules or D-Mods for short. The Dink Network
(http://www.dinknetwork.com/) hosts a copy of almost all of them.


GNU FreeDink
------------

GNU FreeDink is a new version of the game engine, which runs the
original game as well as its D-Mods, with close compatibility, under
new platforms.

FreeDink can run in 2 modes:

* v1.08 (default): this matches the latest release of the Dink engine,
  which includes some new features and some backward-incompatible
  changes. Use it for recent D-Mods.

* v1.07 (with option '--v1.07'): this matches v1.07 of the Dink
  engine, essentially unmodified since 1998. Use it to play D-Mods
  released before 2006.

Next step is extending the engine while preserving accurate support
for released D-Mods.

On the technical level, the internals of the engines experience a
clean-up to allow for portability and later improvements.

GNU
---

FreeDink is part of the GNU project, whose aim is to create "GNU", a
completely free (as in freedom) operating system. Its most famous
variant these days is GNU/Linux. A engine to play the Dink Smallwood
game and D-Mods is definitely a must for the GNU OS ;) Check
http://www.gnu.org/ for more information.


Building
--------
