From a game library point of view, the game has 3 parts:

- sound
  BGM = Audio CD + MIDI;
  SFX = WAV with multiple channels/banks, pseudo-3D positionning
  (per-channel volume and panning), real-time frequency change

- graphics
  - 2D, 640*480*256
  - windowed or full-screen
  - stretching/scaling (SDL doesn't do that alone)
  - fonts (TTF)

- input
  - keyboard
  - joystick


([TODO] means I need to actually test the libraries.)


Choice:
~~~~~~~

If chose SDL because the previous port was made using SDL, so there is
already a semi-working port that I can study during the initial port
to the GNU OS.

So there is no definite, justified choice to use SDL. It really was
the easier way for me to perform an initial and clean cross-platform
port.



Alternatives:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General-purpose:

- Allegro is another interesting alternative. I think it would be good
  to eventually get FreeDink be able to compile with either library -
  at least that would make the code more flexible if SDL ever get
  replaced by something else. Allegro tend to get everything included
  in the main library, while SDL separates a core library from
  additional ones (SDL_mixer, SDL_image, SDL_gfx, SDL_ttf...).

- DX: that what we come from, it's proprietary and not portable, so of
  course we won't use it back.


Some component-specific libraries are:

- Graphics: Mesa (OpenGL), that apparently could take care of all the
  2D graphical part.

- SFX: OpenAL for a good SFX (no MIDI, no audio CD) mixer.



Comparison:
~~~~~~~~~~~

It would be good to make a spreadsheet and show the possible combinations.

The conclusion is that no library does _everything_ we need, but the
sum of all their features do.

Required: SDL for audio CD.

- Stretching:

  [V] [TODO] SDL_strech or SDL_gfx should do.

  [V] [TODO] Allegro does.

  [V] [TODO] Mesa does.

- Fonts (TTF):

  [V] [TODO] SDL_ttf does.

  [V] [TODO] Allegro should do.

  [V] [TODO] OpenGL+SDL_ttf+an SDL surface rendered as a texture. Or
  use FreeType2 directly.


- Input (keyboard, joystick):

  [V] [TODO] SDL should do.

  [V] [TODO] Allegro should do.

  [V] [TODO] GLUT (Mesa, freeglut, OpenGlut) should do.


- Sound Frequency:

  [ ] SDL(_Mixer) does not provide an equivalent to DX' SetFrequency, and
  [TODO] I don't think it can be implement on top of it (check
  sound.txt)

  [V] [TODO] Allegro does.

  [V] [TODO] OpenAL does.

- MIDIs:

  [V] SDL_Mixer does that perfectly, independently from SFX.

  [V] [TODO] Allegro does.

  [ ] OpenAL doesn't.
  
- Audio CD:

  [V] SDL does that perfectly, independently.

  [ ] Allegro doesnt.

  [ ] OpenAL doesn't.


Wishes:
~~~~~~~

Features we plan to add afterwhile...

- Fixed rate

  [V] [TODO] SDL_gfx does.

- 16/24/32 bits support

  [V] [TODO] SDL does.

  [V] Allegro does.

  [?] Mesa

- Graphics rotation:

  [V] [TODO] SDL_gfx does.

  [V] [TODO] Allegro does.

  [V] [TODO] Mesa does.
