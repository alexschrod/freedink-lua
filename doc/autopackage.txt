Autopackage
===========

Homepage: http://autopackage.org/

This tool acts as a wrapper for GCC and tries hard to produce a
package that can work on many GNU/Linux distributions. No .deb / .rpm
/ .tgz with different versions of each distros - one size fits all!

In particular, it will recompile with an older glibc that everybody
have, and double-compile C++ apps against libstdc++ versions 5 and 6.


My favorite documentation so far is the tutorial:
http://autopackage.org/docs/tutorials/glb.html
and the explanation of binary portability issues:
http://autopackage.org/docs/devguide/ch07.html


Our autopackage was init'd through:
makepackage --mkspec > default.apspec.in


Currently we do not deal with SDL dependencies, this will be fixed
later on.
