Make tests. Make tests. Make tests! Since the goal of the project is
to be backward compatible, and since we're up to non-trivially change
the code, we need to check that we didn't introduce
incompatibilities. Regression tests are not easy to perform on an
interactive programs. However, we can test each non-interactive part
independently. For example, we could start a game in memory, change a
few sprite, save the game, the check if the saved game is exactly
(modulo the timestamp) to a saved game generated likewise using the
current Dink version, that is patch dink.exe v1.07.


Regression tests: these (manual) tests are currently working, but test
again after making changes!

When DinkC scripts are involved, placing them in a key-*.c file comes
in very handy :)


Graphics
========

Background
----------

- Make sure dinkm-12.bmp from Mystery Island's dir.ff (the last frame
  of the Dink->duck morphing sequence) is correctly displayed. That
  dir.ff is somewhat corrupted and there's a work-around in dir.ff to
  read it nonetheless.

- Try to show_bmp("../island/tiles/ship5.bmp"). It uses a different
  palette, with gradients. If there's no gradient at the top-right
  corner of the image, around the third mast, then something wrong
  happened to the image and/or the palette. I got that bug when
  SDL_BlitSurface'ing between Surface with different palettes; instead
  of just copying the pixels, SDL also dithered the image.

- copy_bmp_to_screen("../island/tiles/ship5.bmp") should switch the
  engine palette, so you see the background boat perfectly and get
  weird colours for everything
  else. copy_bmp_to_screen("../lyna/tiles/shadow.bmp") from Lyna's
  Story switches to "Shadow mode", i.e. reversed palette. Due to DX's
  fixed 0 and 255 indexes, perfectly white and black pixels remain
  white and black, so the image is not completely negative - _that's
  the original behavior, not a bug_.

- With a DinkC script, fill the screen in a room with black
  background, with different colors. Index 0 is black (not white as in
  the Dink Palette). 

- Use a different palette for a tile: the colours should be
  interpolated to the Ts01.bmp's palette during the game.


Sound
=====

- Pick the bag of pigs feed in the first Dink screen, or pick one of
  these little hearts when you break a barrel. The picking sound is
  SWORD2.WAV but played at rate 22kHz instead of the file-specified
  8kHz. If you hear a sword sound instead of a picking sound, then
  rate conversion does not work.
