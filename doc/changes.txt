If cd is not present and use a midi > 1000, then play that midi, and
not #midi-1000. That's what is done with playmidi() - although this is
actually a bug :) The code should also play #midi-1000 there, but
there's a missing "return;", and thus the game plays #midi right
after.

If a cd is present, it is taken into account (for playing 100X tracks)
even if it doesn't have exactly 19 tracks.

The two WAVE files played by Dinkedit were extracted from Dinkedit.exe
v1.06's resources and are now external. Incidentally those were
missing (as well as the application icon) in Dinkedit v1.07. Also,
stop.wav had to be converted by Audacity to get accepted by SDL_Mixer
("Complex WAVE files not supported").
