Nice project:
http://www.nongnu.org/mingw-cross-env/

It basically does what we do in cross.txt.

Pros:
- Can check for new upstream releases
- Dependency system
- Maintained by other people so we don't have to do it
- More packages
- Uses the newly added .pc files in SDL_* to handle indirect static
  dependencies (Libs.private) (note that distro packages don't have
  them yet).

Cons:
- FreeType compiled without the patents-threatened hinting engine,
  hence incompatible font display / metrics with the original Dink
  version and the Debian FreeType package.
- DX support in SDL seems unstable as of 2010-04 - developers are
  apparently experimenting with free headers, which is good.
- MP3 support in SDL_mixer, while we don't want to foster that format.
- No FLAC support in SDL_mixer as of 2010-04 (explicitely disabled)
- No SDL_gfx as of 2010-04
- Only support static linking (no .dll's); it doesn't really matter
  for us, as FreeDink is a GPL'd project.  It would matter if we were
  not distributing the source code, because the LGPL (for instance)
  would require us to either ship our .o files or use the library as a
  .dll.  Still, this means all libraries will be embedded in all
  executables (e.g. both in freedink and freedinkedit).
  Also on security update, we'd need to provide a new executable
  instead of a fixed .dll, but we're already providing static builds,
  so we'll need to rebuild anyway.
- Still need to ship a copy of each library's license manually (and
  we'll have to extract it manually)
- Some tarballs do not download properly (404 or timeout)
- Recompiles MinGW instead of reusing installed version (long).
- Still need to compile libraries (not binary releases) - but at the
  same time this means customizing is easier.
- When providing multiple executables, all executables will bundle all
  the dependencies (instead of sharing DLLs), needing more space.
  (on the other hand, one static .exe is usually smaller than one
  dynamic .exe + its .dll's)

We see that it would save us time, but at the same time we'd need to
patch it to keep full precise control of the configuration.

Some packages are missing, and new SDL_* .pc files are not in distros
yet, so all in all, it seems better to wait for now.
