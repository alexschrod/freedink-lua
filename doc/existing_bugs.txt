Bugs that existed in v1.07 and needs to be fixed:

- [UNCONFIRMED] repeating sounds are kept alive when you "restart from
  scratch"

- Do not take [space] into account for killing a text if the text just
  appeared on the screen

- When saying a text near the border of a screen, it isn't placed
  correctly the very first time it's displayed

- say_stop*(&sprite, ...) kills other text sprites related to
  &sprite. Unfortunately this prevents those other texts to return to
  their originating script, because of kill_text_owned_by(). This is
  discussed in http://www.dinknetwork.com/forum.cgi?MID=92406 so it's
  also present in v1.08.
