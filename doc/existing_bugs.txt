Bugs that existed in v1.07 and needs to be fixed:

- [UNCONFIRMED] repeating sounds are kept alive when you "restart from
  scratch"

- Do not take [space] into account for killing a text if the text just
  appeared on the screen

- When saying a text near the border of a screen, it isn't placed
  correctly the very first time it's displayed

For fixed bugs, see changes.txt.
