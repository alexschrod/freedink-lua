- Woe idioms such as BYTE or DWORD were replaced by their actual, C
  meaning.

- Woe-specific basic functions were replaced by ANSI C, ISO C or POSIX
  equivalents (strnicmp => strncasecmp, ltoa=>sprintf...).

- MAX_PATH is PATH_MAX under Unix. I mailed bug-gnulib.c so that maybe
  this could be taken into account in gnulib's pathmax.h.

- Woe can open file in text mode (by default). This is only used to
  read dink.ini (DinkC files are opened in binary mode). There is no
  text mode under Unix, so we open all files under binary mode "b" and
  adapt their processing if needed (in this case, we modified
  separate_string()). This way the files are opened the same way on
  all platforms.
