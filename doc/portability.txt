- Woe idioms such as BYTE or DWORD were replaced by their actual, C
  meaning.

- Woe-specific basic functions were replaced by ANSI C, ISO C or POSIX
  equivalents (strnicmp => strncasecmp, ltoa=>sprintf...).

- MAX_PATH is PATH_MAX under Unix. I mailed bug-gnulib.c so that maybe
  this could be taken into account in gnulib's pathmax.h.

- Woe can open file in text mode (by default). This is only used to
  read dink.ini (DinkC files are opened in binary mode). There is no
  text mode under Unix, so we open all files under binary mode "b" and
  adapt their processing if needed (in this case, we modified
  separate_string()). This way the files are opened the same way on
  all platforms.

- To directly support filenames as they are used in DMods - that is,
  without case sensitivity - all fopen() calls use ciconvert() or
  ciconvertbuf() to first find the filename case-insensitively. For
  example, "TILES/Splash.BMP" will be converted to
  "Tiles/Splash.bmp". This is also necessary when writing a file: the
  file may already exist, or the parent directory may name need to be
  converted. Another solution to this issue would be to convert all
  files names to lowercase beforehand - but it is more convenient to
  play unmodified DMods directly.
