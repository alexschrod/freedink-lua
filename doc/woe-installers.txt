We need a way to make installer for woe.

Constraints:

- free software license

- ability to generate the installer automatically

- runnable from GNU/Linux


NSIS - Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page
License: zlib
Used by Mozilla Firefox (itself uncompressed from a 7zip SFX)
Used by dinksmallwood108.exe :)
Debian has package 'nsis' which lacks a few features that requires
  MSVC to compile.
Generation from GNU/Linux reported successful at:
http://www.xdevsoftware.com/blog/post/How-to-Install-the-Nullsoft-Installer---NSIS-on-Linux-.aspx


7-Zip
http://www.7-zip.org/
License: LGPL
Some automated generation is possible:
http://www.msfn.org/board/How-to-make-a-7-Zip-Switchless-Installer-t39048.html
Essentially:
cat <<EOF > config.txt
;!@Install@!UTF-8!
RunProgram="program.exe â€“switch"
;!@InstallEnd@!
EOF
cat 7zS.sfx config.txt myarchive.7z > myinstaller.exe
