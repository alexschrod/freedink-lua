Other sources of information
============================

The v1.08 announcement mentions a plan to reuse all improvements from
the "reDink" version, which are described in its readme_reDink.txt.

The included dinkc.chm has a section "Internal Functions by Version"
with a "v1.08+" entry, describing all added DinkC commands.


List of changes
===============

Compiled by merging the list of fixes in each of the links above:

Framerate: see framerate.txt. It also sets the Dink speed a bit
differently, but I'm unsure of the effect.


From dinkc.chm, entry for say():

"Also in 1.07 and earlier, Dink would not interpret lines with a colon
correctly, like so:say("bonus: 5 points", 1); // would not display any
text at all!This issue has also been fixed in 1.08."

entry for sp_move_nohard():
"In 1.07 and earlier, the move_no_hard value only had an effect when
the active_sprite was actively moving (through move and move_stop
commands).In 1.08+, the move_no_hard value should take effect at all
times."

entry for show_bmp():
"1.07 had a couple bugs displaying the map dot: it would not be
displayed properly if Dink was warped using DinkC or if he was on the
32nd screen of any row.Â  This has been fixed in 1.08+."

[TODO]


Diffs
=====

Files cannot be diffed directly because the indentation
changed. Indenting both v1.07 and v1.08 using 'indent' (no option)
allows you to get small diffs suitable for review:
  indent 107/update_frame.cpp 108/Dink/update_frame.cpp
  diff -u -Bbw 107/update_frame.cpp 108/Dink/update_frame.cpp | less

Removing ^M characters can make the reading more pleasurable:
  find 107/ 108/ -type f | xargs sed -i -e 's/\r//g'

Digest:
- dink.cpp: ~75kB. Numerous references to the console mode, which
  needs to take over input at several points in the code.

- dinkedit.cpp: only a few grammar changes.

- update_frame.cpp: ~7kB. mconsole, framerate, one thing about MIDI,
  and a couple clean-up.

- dinkvar.h: ~190kB. TrueColor mode, scope?, ...


Compilation
===========

The readme.txt says that you need VS.NET or VS2005. The 'Express'
version from MS won't work, because it only support console and .net
applications (eg. it's doesn't provide windows.h).

Trying to compile with VC++6 triggers lots of C++ template errors and
one undefined DDLOCK_DONOTWAIT symbol, plus loads of warnings about
truncated mangled names. I haven't put much work into it.
