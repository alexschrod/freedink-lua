Future

mode is not initialized in dinkvar.h.
It is, I think, first initialized in dink.cpp in doInit().
process_line() from dinkvar.h also set its value.


At a point, mode needs to be properly initialized somewhere, to avoid
"duplicating" the variable in each object file that uses it.


When sprites are disabled for N minutes with editor_type(), the 'N
minutes' are computed with the value SDL_GetTicks() the last time you
entered the screen. This can be a problem:

- Generally: the last_time per-screen value is reset each time the
  screen is loaded. This means that if you enter a screen once every 5
  minutes, the counter will always be reset, and you'll never see
  enemies reappearing. This is more complex to fix, as it probably
  requires altering the savegame format.

- SDL-specific: if you quit and restart the game, then SDL_GetTicks is
  reset. In the woe version, you needed to reboot the computer (not
  the game) to get the same effect. So maybe we can check if N minutes
  passed using a timestamp instead.
