Data from the original game commonly needed by D-Mods
=====================================================

Now that we have a working portable game engine, it would make sense
to distribute it along with all data necessary to run D-Mods.

Such a pack already exists: it's a repackaging of v1.06 made by Dan
Walma and approved by Seth A. Robinson:
http://files.dinknetwork.com/dinksmallwood106.zip

It's also possible to extract the data using the '7z' extraction tool
from http://files.dinknetwork.com/dinksmallwood108.exe
(see contrib/dextract for an automated extraction script)

However, it's not free (as in freedom), thus it cannot be included in
GNU/Linux distributions. Apparently, Seth want to keep control over
Dink Smallwood: the character, the story, etc., which is why this data
will probably stay non-free.

The graphics pack, though, was released under a pretty lax license
(free for D-Mods and freeware games). A compromise would be to extend
this to a subset of the Dink Smallwood original story. This subset
would not cover the original Dink Smallwood story, but would cover
files commonly required by D-Mods.

This way, FreeDink would ship with a free base data pack that could be
included in distros and could run any D-Mod out of the box.

We could also imagine creating a very small pack containing the
missing non-free story files, so that people could easily play the
original game after installing FreeDink.


Graphics differences
--------------------

(between dinkgraphics.zip and an extraction of all dir.ff files)

dinkgraphics.zip is free for everybody to use in "FREEWARE"
games. This is a good candidate for the base data pack. However, it is
not complete because it has a few differences with the original Dink
graphics.


Method for the comparison:

- extraction of dir.ff files using utils/ffrextract.c

- all filenames to lowercase using lc_dmod.sh (from old SDL port)

- diff -r dinkgraphics/ 106/dink/graphics/


Results:

- graphics/effects/magic: the original game's end boss animation
  (poseXX.bmp and sethXwXX.bmp) are not present in dinkgraphics. These
  graphics are used in some D-Mods such as End of Time v2.

- item-w22.bmp and item-w23.bmp (herb boots graphics) are missing in
  dinkgraphics.

- graphics/items/food/food-31.bmp (King Daniel!) is missing in
  dinkgraphics.

- lands/trees/treefire/tree-f17.bmp is somewhat corrupted in
  dinkgraphics (about 4 rows of pixels are postponed 2 pixels to the
  right, which looks ugly). Same for struct/castle/castl-03.bmp,
  struct/castle/castl-08.bmp, struct/castle/castl-09.bmp,
  struct/home/home-06.bmp, struct/home/home-09.bmp

- inter/text-box/main-01.bmp is different (there's an additional white
  area in dinkgraphics, which was probably removed later on to make
  the text easier to read)


Other differences that do not matter:

- dink/morph: dinkgraphics is not properly numbered so it can't be
  used directly as a sequence), but all the animation frames are the
  same. dinkgraphics also has an extra frame (dinkm17.bmp)! Mystery
  Island did copy this animation in their graphics/ directory rather
  reuse it from the original graphics anyway.

- there's a top-level dir.ff that contains a copy of
  inter\text-box\main-


Note: there was no change to graphics/ in v1.07 and v1.08, so this
comparison is valid for those versions too.


Tiles
-----

All tiles from the original games were reused in various D-Mods. It
would be good to be able to redistribute them all.

Tiles also depend on HARD.DAT for the default tile hardness, so this
file is also necessary.


Scripts
-------

At first glance, here is the list of all DinkC files that may be used
in D-Mods (as opposed to: "related to the original Dink Smallwood
story itself").

Those are good candidates for the base data pack.

Sounds
------

All sounds and music from the original games (except for the
commercial CD audio tracks) were reused in various D-Mods.

In addition, freedinkedit.exe (from version 1.06) contains 2 embedded
sounds that were extracted and shipped with FreeDink - they need legal
clarification.

There's the status, after a discussion with Seth A. Robinson.

Unfortunately, most of the sounds effects are not redistributable. We
should replace them.

Some MIDIs were made by Seth. Other midis have unclear legal status
and should not be redistributed - or we need to find their original
source again.

Duplicates:
- 4.mid, Battle.mid [battle with soldiers]
- 6.mid, 18.mid [end boss theme]
- 10.mid, 107.mid, Caveexpl.mid [cave]
