Shawn Betts wrote the first version of fastfile.c. Moreover, code from
his contribution to "The Dink Project" was reused, namely from
load_palette_from_bmp(), setup_palette(), load_sprite_pak(),
print_text(), print_text_wrap(), font_len(),
process_text_for_wrapping(), CheckJoyStickPresent().


Sylvain Beucler started from the v1.07 source code release and, except
the code from Shawn Betts, wrote it all.
