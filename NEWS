1.08.20080731: in progress

FreeDink is a port of the Dink game engine, so it can work under
operating systems (e.g. GNU/Linux) and architectures (e.g. PowerPC).

After essentially 1 year of active development, I think I've now
reached the point where FreeDink can run any D-Mod v1.08 improvements
are supported, and there's also a "v1.07 mode" to play D-Mods that
aren't upgraded yet (such as Eternal Suicide). DFArc2 was made
portable too, and has a new checkbox for this mode.

I put a lot of effort into maintaining compatibility, including
features that, well, weren't supposed to work, but still did (Seth
magic ). The port also allowed me to add better windowed mode, which
can support non-truecolor (e.g. for Lyna's Story or Cycles of Evil)
and you can switch windowed/full-screen using Alt + Enter. I think the
truecolor fades are faster/smoother too.

Some other fixes were made in the game engine and in the editor.
