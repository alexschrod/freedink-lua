jump.wav, stop.wav, stop-orig.wav
=================================

Sound files used by Dinkedit. There were included in v1.06 as
Dinkedit.exe resources (included in the executable).

The resources were forgotten in v1.07, so if you noticed that sound
and application icon were missing, that's the reason :)


stop.wav (now stop-orig.wav) had to be re-written using Audacity to
make it compatible with SDL_Mixer.


Legal: not necessarily freely distributable. I need to ask Seth.


freedink.ico
============

(and hence freedink.bmp, freedink_xpm.c, freedink.png)

From the original Dink source package, see doc/license-orig.txt
