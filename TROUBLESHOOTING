Troubleshooting
===============

Q: Under GNU/Linux, FreeDink freezes when trying to play a sound or
   music.

A: SDL_mixer (the component that provides the sound) is known to
   freeze when:
   * /dev/sequencer is present and
   * /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg isn't.
   An easy fix is to install Timidity++ (see BUILD).
