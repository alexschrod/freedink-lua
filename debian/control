Description: adventure and role-playing game (engine)
 Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game for MS Windows,
 similar to Zelda, made by RTsoft. Besides twisted humour, it includes
 the actual game editor, allowing players to create hundreds of new
 adventures called Dink Modules or D-Mods for short.
 .
 GNU FreeDink is a new version of the game engine, which runs the
 original game as well as its D-Mods, with close compatibility, under
 new platforms.
